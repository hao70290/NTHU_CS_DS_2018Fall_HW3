# NTHU_CS_DS_2018Fall_HW3
Construct a tree from the s-expression and implement some functions.

## implementation
•Construct_tree  
•Tree traversal  
•Tree height  
•Weight sum  
•Maximum Path Sum  
•Invert  

## Input
Input will be a string, which is an s-expression of a binary tree.  
e.g. (1(2(4()())(5()()))(3(6()())(7()())))  
-100 <= Node weight <= 100   
  
0 < Node_id < 100000    
For rotate,  0 < k < 100000    

## Output
After constructing the tree, you have to print the following information of this tree.

In-order traversal  
Pre-order traversal  
Post-order traversal  
Level-order traversal  
Height of tree  
Weight sum of tree  
Maximum path sum of tree  
In-order traversal after inverting  
Pre-order traversal after inverting  
Post-order traversal after inverting  
Level-order traversal after inverting
